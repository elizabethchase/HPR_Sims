# HPR_Sims

This repository houses code to reproduce the simulations and data analysis performed in
Chase, Taylor, and Boonstra (2022+). To run the simulations, you will need to install
the corresponding HPR R package from https://github.com/elizabethchase/HPR. In addition,
our simulations are run using the Dynamic Statistical Comparisons (DSC) framework 
developed by the Stephens Lab. More information on DSC can be found at https://stephenslab.github.io/dsc-wiki/overview.html.

The repo contains the following folder/scripts:

- DSC_files: this is a folder containing all of the DSC scripts that were run to perform
the simulations

- extract_results.R: the script used to convert the results from the above DSC files into
CSVs or R datasets, which are stored in the folder Finished_Results

- Finished_Results: a folder containing the results from the DSC scripts and extract_results.R

- sim_results.Rmd: a Markdown file to create all of the simulation plots in Chase et al. (2022+)
from the results in Finished_Results

- Finished_Plots: a folder containing all of the plots generated by sim_results.Rmd

- Data_application: a folder containing a Markdown script and dataset used to conduct the 
data analysis in Chase et al. (2022+), and the plots that were created
